NAME
      Truncated Configuration Interaction Calculator
SYNOPSIS
      Computes the energy from a truncated configuration interaction wavefunction. 
USAGE
      CISD [-f <matrix_file>] [-p <print_level>] [-s <substitutions>] [--help]
OPTIONS
      -f matrix_file                   Input matrix file with initial set of molecular orbitals.

      -p print_level                   Verbosity of output. Default print level is 1. Options
                                       0-4.

      -s substitutions                 Substitution levels permitted in truncated CI calculation.
                                       Input is a comma delimited list of numbers inside square 
                                       brackets. The reference is always included and any level
                                       and combination of truncations can be specified. 

                                       E.g. [1,2,4] specifies truncated CI with all single, double 
                                       and quadruple substitutions.

      --help                           Output help documentation to terminal.

NOTES
      Compilation of this program requires the MQC library (https://github.com/MQCPack/mqcPack)
      and the gauopen utility (http://gaussian.com/g16/gauopen.zip) and compilation with the
      f08 standard.

      Compilation tested using: gfortran 12.2.0

      Note that subroutine Wr_LCBuf needs modifying in gauopen/qcmatrix.F as follows:
        line 58:       LenBX = (LenBuf/(2*abs(NR)))*abs(NR)
        line 60:       Call Wr_CBuf(IU,NTot*abs(NR),LenBX,X)

      Documentation generated with robodoc. To update documentation edit robodoc.rc to
      determine documentation output type and then run robodoc at the command line in the
      main directory.
